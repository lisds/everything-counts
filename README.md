# Everything Counts

This repository contains materials for the 2024/25 MASc Everything
Counts module, namely labs and exercises, both as Jupyter Notebooks.

*Note on structure*: materials are organised by week, placed in a
 subfolder for that week.

*Note on nomenclature*: 01-1-lab means "week 1" "class 1" "lab".

The files are based on the excellent work of [Vural
Aksakalli](https://github.com/akmand/statististics_tutorials) and
[Imran Ture](https://www.imranture.com/labs/os/), who put together
Python lab files based on the [OpenIntro
Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) (2019, 4th edition)
textbook.
