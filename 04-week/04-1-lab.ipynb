It follows a low-budget team, the Oakland Athletics, who believed that underused statistics, such as a player's ability to get on base, betterpredict the ability to score runs than typical statistics like home runs, RBIs (runs batted in), and batting average. Obtaining players who excelled in these underused statistics turned out to be much more affordable for the team.\n",
