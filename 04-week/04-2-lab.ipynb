    "Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. The article titled, \"Beauty in the classroom: instructors' pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity\" (Hamermesh and Parker, 2005) found that instructors who are viewed to be better looking receive higher instructional ratings.

Hamermesh, Amy Parker, Beauty in the classroom: instructors pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity, *Economics of Education Review*, Volume 24, Issue 4, August 2005, Pages 369-376, ISSN 0272-7757, 10.1016/j.econedurev.2004.07.013. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775704001165.)\n",
