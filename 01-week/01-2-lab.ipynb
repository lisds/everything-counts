    "Basketball players who make several baskets in succession are described as having a hot hand. Fans and players have long believed in the hot hand phenomenon, which refutes the assumption that each shot is independent of the next. However, a 1985 [paper](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/7782/readings/gilovich%20vallone%20tversky.pdf) by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky collected evidence that contradicted this belief and showed that successive shots are independent events. This paper started a great controversy that continues to this day, as you can see by Googling hot hand basketball.\n",

The goals for this lab are to (1) think about the effects of independent and dependent events, (2) learn how to simulate shooting streaks in Python, and (3) to compare a simulation to actual data in order to determine if the hot hand phenomenon appears to be real."
